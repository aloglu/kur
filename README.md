# kur
`kur` is a simple shell script to help me set up a new Fedora system.

# Usage
Its usage is pretty straightforward. The script should be executable out of the box but if it isn't, go to the folder you cloned the repository into and then type `chmod +x kur.sh`. You can then type `./kur.sh` to run it.

# Notes
`kur` includes a set up of my [dotfiles](https://github.com/aloglu/dotfiles), but it's optional. dotfiles is excluded from the option that installs everything.
